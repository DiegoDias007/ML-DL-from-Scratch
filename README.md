# ML & DL from Scratch
This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms built from scratch. The primary goal is to foster a strong foundational understanding of how these algorithms work internally, relying mainly on Python and NumPy for the core logic.
